Untrusted/unreliable
If it is the only possible source of the information, how can we verify it?
Data that has been manipulated by humans. Human error/bias.
If anyone can come in and edit the data, this opens a route to fraud/misinformation.
Facebook.
If there is incentive to cherry-pick information or deceive or twist the truth etc., be sceptical.
Cherry-picking data implies that the author fears that data.
Peer review (again):
Academic rivals might unjustly discredit you in peer review, try to prevent you from getting published.
Conversely, friends and colleagues might give you a free thumbs-up if you give them one in return.
You can sometimes even choose who reviews your paper.

Uncertain/somewhere in between
E.g. Wikipedia. The veracity/accuracy of the information is no better or worse than the knowledge present in the community at large.
Scientific/academic articles with neutral political affiliation tend to be among the most accurate. No incentive by laypeople to spread misinformation on those pages.
Profiles of celebrities can evoke opinionated/polarised views. Counterfactual or outside of the realm of facts.
Censorship & cherry-picking. What aren’t I seeing? Could censorship have occurred before I ever saw the data? E.g. children’s books can be censored before children have a chance to see what books are available. Stunts/inhibits learning.
