Examples of reliable sources:
Government websites. Implicitly high(ish) trust level. Why? Generally a lack of conflict of interest.
Not for profit.
Accountability. Many eyes watching.
High transparency.
If there is low/no conflict of interest, increases implicit trust.
Raw data taken by instruments of known accuracy and bias has a calculable accuracy or precision
Verifiable/able to be cross-referenced with another source. E.g. when running a Google search, compare multiple sources.
Tests for trustworthiness:
Five (or maybe 4½) "W"s:
Who is the author.
What is the purpose of the content?
Where is the content from?
Why does the source exist?
How does it compare to others.
CRAAP test (to evaluate your sources):
Currency - the timeliness of the information.
Relevance - the importance of the information for your needs.
Authority - the source of the information.
Accuracy - the reliability, truthfulness, and correctness of the content.
Purpose -
Textbooks.
Scientific papers/reviews. Peer-reviewed.
Peer review. Other experts (peers) are invited to scrutinise the methods and findings of a scientific paper. Only if peer review is passed is the paper published. It all sounds good in theory, and surely has a net positive effect on the quality of published papers.
